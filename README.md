This is my Debian SwayWM autoinstall script.

Dependencies:

1. Core packages (required)
 - sway, swaybg, swayidle, swaylock, wlroots,
waybar,....

2. Terminal
 - Choose whatever you want! In this case, I use foot.

3. App launcher
 - Wofi

4. Notification Center
 - I highly recommend use dunst for its lightweight and
more easily to config. But ofc you can use whatever you want!
I'll give you some options!
 - 

You can possibly use the GTK4 config as backups
